        <p>
            On the top right you will see Canvas, that's where you draw. Don't worry, it's intuitive!!
            <br><br>
            On this page the centeral white space is your creative space. The left panel contains all the different shape options and 
            the right panel has all the different color options. More colors and shapes coming soon! On the bottom there are 4 buttons, 
            clear, undo, priview, download. More about those later.
            <br><br>
            Default shape selected is a bucket looking one used to change the background and the defualt color is black. You can 
            select any color and make that the background. Background can be changed at any time without affecting the design on top!! 
            Select any shape from the left panel and select a color from the right and hover your mouse over the central canvas to 
            preview that shape. You can also change the size of the shape by clicking either of the arrow keys! Experiment with 
            different shapes and colors and sizes. Preview the design at different locations and once satisfied left click and it will 
            paste it at that location. If you make a mistake that's fine, we have the undo button!
            <br><br>
            More about buttons! Clear will clear the whole canvas and it will revert back to a blank white. Be careful while 
            using this, there is no way of going back. Undo button will remove the last pasted shape and it can be used multiple times. It 
            however won't revert the background, but no worries, use the background shape for that! Preview and Download are still in 
            progress. Look out for updates!
